## Project Statement:

The problem statement revolves around the urgent need for wildlife conservation and the preservation of biodiversity. Declining populations, habitat destruction, and the endangerment of species highlight the critical challenges faced by wildlife. The lack of awareness, education, and actionable steps for individuals to contribute further exacerbates the problem. It is crucial to address these issues by raising awareness, inspiring stewardship, and providing accessible avenues for people to actively participate in conservation efforts. By doing so, we can work towards protecting wildlife, restoring ecosystems, and ensuring a sustainable future for both humans and the natural world.
 
## Project Description:

Real estate is considered real property that includes land and anything permanently attached to it or built on it, whether natural or man-made. There are five main categories of real estate which include residential, commercial, industrial, raw land, and special use. Investing in real estate includes purchasing a home, rental property, or land. Indirect investment in real estate can be made via REITs or through pooled real estate investment.

## Azure Technologies used :

1. **Static Web Apps**: Simplified deployment and hosting solution for static websites.
2. **Azure Storage Accounts**: Secure and scalable storage solution for various data types.
3. **Container**: Lightweight and portable environment for deploying and managing applications.

## Web Technologies used :

1. **HTML**: The standard markup language for creating the structure and content of web pages.
2. **CSS**: The style sheet language used for styling and formatting the visual appearance of web pages.
3. **JavaScript**: The programming language that enables interactive and dynamic functionality on web pages.

## IDE Used :

**Visual Studio Code**

## Steps followed While Deploying :

1. Initially, I developed the entire project using Visual Studio Code and tested it using the Live Server extension.
2. Subsequently, I installed Git on my system to facilitate version control.
3. Following that, I uploaded and committed the project to my GitHub repository.
4. To make the project accessible, I deployed it using GitHub Pages and performed thorough testing.
5. Then, I logged into my Azure account and created an Azure Storage Account.
6. In the Azure Storage Account, I created a container using Blob storage and uploaded my project code into it.
7. Once completed, I initiated the static web service and deployed my website using Azure Static Web Services.
8. Finally, my website was successfully deployed on Azure Web Services and is now ready for usage.
